These two programs working as ingest data from Citi-Bike real time station data. I also insert which day (Mon to Sun) and time (Morning or Night or Noon) in every json object.

After data ingestion, the one tuple(JSON object) is like:

{"altitude":"","availableDocks":28,"city":"","statusValue":"In Service","latitude":40.76727216,"postalCode":"","testStation":false,"stAddress1":"W 52 St & 11 Ave","totalDocks":39,"stAddress2":"","landMark":"","lastCommunicationTime":"2016-12-02 05:12:18 PM","statusKey":1,"stationName":"W 52 St & 11 Ave","location":"","id":72,"time":"Night","day":"Fri","longitude":-73.99392888,"availableBikes":8}
